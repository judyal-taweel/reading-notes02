# List 

HTML provides us with three different types of lists:

- Ordered lists :
<ol></ol>and write <li><li>inside it.

are lists where each item in the list is numbered.

- Unordered lists :
<ul></ul>and write <li></li>inside it.

are lists that begin with a bullet point.

Definition lists :
are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

<dl></dl>and write inside it <td></td>then after <td></td>will write <dd></dd> This is used to contain the definition.

- Nested Lists :

<table> : element tag to create table.
<tr> : start the table using it.(table row).
<td> : to write the table data.
<th> : table heading to represent the heading for either a column or a row.

Also we can do spanning columns and spanning rows in the table to stretch across more than one column or rows.
