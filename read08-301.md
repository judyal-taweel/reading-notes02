# SQL-Structured Query Language

is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.

There are many popular SQL databases including SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned. It has a specific syntax though, which is what we are going to learn in the following exercises.
