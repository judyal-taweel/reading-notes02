# Lists

HTML provides us with three different types of lists:

- Ordered lists :

`<ol></ol>`and write `<li><li>`inside it.

are lists where each item in the list is numbered.

- Unordered lists :

`<ul></ul>`and write `<li></li>`inside it.

 are lists that begin with a bullet point.

- Definition lists :

 are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

 `<dl></dl>`and write inside it `<td></td>`then after `<td></td>`will write `<dd></dd>` This is used to contain the definition.

 - Nested Lists :

### Border, Margin and Padding

1. border :  The border separates the edge of one box from another.
1. margin :  The sit outside the edge of the border.
1. badding :  the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.

we can change colors and dimensions and alot of styles can change on it.

Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.

CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.
