# The HTTP Request Lifecycle

 1. Local Processing: Depending on how in depth you want to get `<protocol>://<host><:optional port>/<path/to/resource><?query>` like that `|http|://|www.example.com||:5000||/mainpage||?query=param&query2=param2|`.the browser extract also the host and optional port number .

 2.  Resolve an IP

If the cache lookup fails (we will assume it does), your browser fires off a DNS request using UDP3. The DNS request contains the preconfigured IP for your DNS server and your return IP in its header. 

3. Establish a TCP Connection 

One of the key differences between TCP and UDP is that TCP ensures delivery and ordered data transmission. Much of this is done very simply, using whatâ€™s known as a sequence number for every byte sent.
