# Heroku :
lets you deploy, run and manage applications written in Ruby, Node.js, Java, Python, Clojure, Scala, Go and PHP.

Heroku is a polyglot[speaking, many languages.] platform it lets you:
- build
- run
- scale applications in a similar manner across all the languages
- utilizing the dependencies and Procfile.
The Procfile exposes an architectural aspect of your application

## Deploying applications :
1. Heroku platform uses Git as the primary means for deploying applications
2. When you create an application on Heroku, it associates a new Git remote, typically named heroku, with the local Git repository for your application. $ git push heroku master

# Node.js For Beginners
First of all, we need to create a JavaScript file. Let's name it server.js:

```
http.createServer( function( request, response) {

response.writeHead( 200, {"Content-Type": "text/plain"} );

response.write( "It's alive!" );

response.end();

}).listen(3000); 
```

make sure it's working. Run at your terminal: node server.js

Let's look more closely at our first Node server. This is an example of how Node provides you with non-blocking and event-driven behavior. Let me explain:

`$.post('/some_requested_resource', function(data) { console.log(data); });`

This code performs a request for some resource
When the response comes back, an anonymous function is called. It contains the argument data, which is the data received from that request.
Node allows you to use the so-called event loop, which works faster because of non-blocking behavior.

# Heroku cloud application :

lets Create your project directory. And then create the server.js file inside of it.

then let's declare some variables:

`var http = require("http");` will give the key to Node's HTTP functionality

`var fs = require("fs");` for possibility to interact with the file system

`var path = require("path");` allows you to handle file paths

`var mime = require("mime");` allows you to determine a file's MIME-type it's not a part of Node.js

***View Activity logs via the command line***

`$ heroku logs --tail`

***Locally run your app***

`$ heroku local web`

***Push local changes***

``` ruby
$ git add .
$ git commit -m"Message"
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku open [app name] (open the app to check if changes went through)
```
