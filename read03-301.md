# avascript Templating

is a technique used to render client-side to view templates with JS by using JSON data source. The template is HTML markup with tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic. Then the template engin will replace variables and instance declared in a template file

### MUSTACHE

is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

why is logic-less : because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only tags

### justify-content Flexbox

- flex-start (default): items are packed toward the start of the flex-direction.

- flex-end: items are packed toward the end of the flex-direction.

- start: items are packed toward the start of the writing-mode direction.

- end: items are packed toward the end of the writing-mode direction.

- left: items are packed toward left edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like start.

- right: items are packed toward right edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like end.

- center: items are centered along the line

- space-between: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line

- space-around: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them.

- space-evenly: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.
