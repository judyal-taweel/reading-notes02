### Object

object stores its state in fields(fields represent the object stats),and exposes its behavior through methods.and data encapsulation It can't be accessed if it is private.

- Modularity: can create object and the source of object maintained independently of the source code for other objects.
- the details of its internal implementation remain hidden from the outside world.

#### class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.

### Inheritance we use it when we creat class need same fields or same functions.`extends `, `class MyClass extends MySuperClass`

### package allow to keep HTML pages in one folder, images in another, and scripts or applications in yet another same the folder in computers.


- Declaring Classes:

`class MyClass {`

`// field, constructor, and method declarations}`

- Declaring Member Variables

modifiers public or private then the type of my field then the field name.(can write it without modifiers).

- Overloaded can declear the method with same name but with deffirent arguments.

- Constructors : can create  one defult constructur without arguments.

- Decimal Numbers : all digin in it has position and the decimal knows us which position.(`Base 10`)

- Binary Numbers: `Base 2`start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits.

- Hexadecimal Numbers: `Base 16` start from 0 to 9 then continue with A,B,C,...
