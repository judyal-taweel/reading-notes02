# Color 
## Foreground color

The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

1. rgb values

`p {`
`color: rgb(100,100,90);}`

 how much red, green and blue are used to make it up.

1. hex codes

`h2 {`
`color: #ee3e80;}`

These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color.

1. color names

`h1 {`
`color: DarkCyan;}`

There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized
by browsers.


## Background color

`body {`
`background-color: rgb(200,200,200);}`

`h1 {`
`background-color: DarkCyan;}`

`h2 {`
`background-color: #ee3e80;}`

`p {`
`background-color: white;}`

## Contrast

- Low Contrast

Text is harder to read when there is low contrast between
background and foreground colors.

- High Contrast

Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast between
background and foreground colors.

- Medium Contrast

For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves
readability.

## Opacity

introduces the opacity property which allows you to
specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements.
The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).

## HSL Colors

1. hue

. In HSL colors, hue is often
represented as a color circle
where the angle represents the
color.

1. saturation

Saturation is the amount of
gray in a color.

1. lightness

Lightness is the amount of
white (lightness) or black
(darkness) in a color.
