# when Women Stopped Coding

nuber of women working in in computer programing was highest of number of the men in 1980 but these number reduce cause: 

- They think that the computer more appropriate for boys than girls .
- They was buying computers for their boys even their girls interesting in computers.
- They was building games for boys.

When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. When YouTubeâ€™s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.

It’s no secret that there is a pronounced gender gap in technology fields. In 2014, 70% of the employees at the top tech companies in Silicon Valley, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, were male. In technical roles, this phenomenon is even more pronounced; for example, only 10% of the technical workforce at Twitter is female.

Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters
