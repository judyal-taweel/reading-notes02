# functional programming

is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

### pure functions

 function that returns the same result if given the same arguments and it doesn't cause any observable side effect.

### Higher-order functions

- Filter

Given a collection, we want to filter by an attribute. The filter function expects a true or false value to determine if the element should or should not be included in the result collection. Basically, if the callback expression is true, the filter function will include the element in the result collection. Otherwise, it will not.

- Map

The idea of map is to transform a collection. The map method transforms a collection by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new collection from the returned values.

- Reduce

The idea of reduce is to receive a function and a collection, and return a value created by combining the items.
